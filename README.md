*Define what software development standards are and why they are important.*

Software development standards encompass coding standards, which include rules such as naming conventions for variables and functions, ensuring the readability and uniformity of the code. Another standard is retention of quality and security; these practices reduce bugs, vulnerabilities to malicious attacks, and improve performance. Another necessary standard is documentation, which includes clear documentation of the code and version control of the software. These standards are crucial for ensuring software development is consistent, maintainable, scalable, and efficient.


*Identify at least three relevant tools used in software development.*

Integrated Development Environment(IDE)
-This is a platform where developers can access the tools needed for software development. IDE typically includes a source code editor, a compiler, and a debugger

Version Control System
-This tool is used to manage and track changes to the source code during the software development process.

Database Management Tools
-This tool is used to enable developers to access, interact with, and manage data.

*Explain the role of version control systems in software projects.*

-The role of version control systems in software projects is to enable a team to develop a project simultaneously without conflict, as well as to track the changes or versions of the source code easily.
